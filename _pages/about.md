I am a Senior Research Fellow in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group at the University of Warwick, currently supported by a Royal Society Newton International Fellowship. My research focuses on the discovery, study, and characterisation of exoplanets - planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy. At Warwick I have worked with Dr David Armstrong on the study of planets in the Neptune desert and with Dr Heather Cegla on characterising orbital architectures of exoplanets and the stellar variability of their host stars with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

I completed my PhD at the University of Birmingham in 2021/22 with a thesis titled "Obliquities of stars from the study of transiting exoplanets and eclipsing binaries" supervised by Professor Amaury Triaud. During my doctoral studies I had a short stint as a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Chicago in 2019/2020 working with Professor Daniel Fabrycky and Dr David Martin on the characterisation of low-mass eclipsing binaries. Between 2021/22 until 2023 I was a postdoc at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ, USA working with Dr Joe Llama on the orbital alignments of mini-Neptunes using the next-generation extreme precision radial velocity spectrograph EXPRES.

Outside of work my interests include latin dancing, weightlifting, travelling, and hiking.
